# :desktop_computer: 42_ft_services
A [42 school](https://www.42.fr/) project using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/fr/). It features a NGINX server, a WordPress website with its MariaDB database, phpMyAdmin for data management, Grafana to monitor the cluster's health, and InfluxDB for the overall cluster's data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Deploy

```shell
# Launch the custom setup script to install everything and deploy the cluster
./setup.sh

# Run the script with the reset argument to shutdown and clean the cluster
./setup.sh -reset
```
### Technical considerations
This project was done on a VM - Linux distribution Ubuntu 10.04.5 LTS, provided by the school. Be aware that it may not work on another distribution.   
    
It uses [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/fr/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/), a utility you can use to run Kubernetes on your local machine. It creates a single node cluster contained in a virtual machine (VM). Most problems regarding launching minikube on the school's VM can be solved using [@ashishae's recommandations](https://www.notion.so/Ft_services-VM-852d4f9b0d9a42c1a2de921e4a2ac417).

## Features

The goal of this project is to learn about **_application deployment_** using Docker and Kubernetes to create a cluster of services working together, **_resilient_** to crashes and other bugs, with an easy **_monitoring_** solution. To that end, I created custom Dockerfiles for each services built on Alpine Linux with their appropriate configuration and deployment pipeline.

### Services

#### MetalLB
[MetalLB](https://github.com/metallb/metallb) is a load-balancer and the entryway to our cluster. Every connection from the outside goes through the load-balancer and redirects the requests to the appropriate service's port and pods depending on the cluster's current status. *(See Fig. 1)*

#### NGINX 
To serve as a bridge between our two main apps, I used [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/), an open source server. Its configuration dictate that every connection to the server via the 80 port is to be redirected systematicaly to the secure 443 port. It also features two routes, `/wordpress` with a 307 redirection to our website and `/phpmyadmin` with a reverse proxy to our admin app. I also added a custom landing page with links to our different services.

#### Wordpress & MariaDB
Wordpress is an open source CMS (Content Management System) 

#### PhpMyAdmin
